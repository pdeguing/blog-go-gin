I’m not really one of this guy who _wants to go to Mars_. I will easily write it anywhere, but it’s more of a joke than an actual commitment. I don’t actually _want_ to go to Mars. It just an easy answer to a lot of questions when people ask. But on the other hand, there is one deep bottom line that I would not deviate from, the strict minimum that I have to achieve in my life. And that is to have the necessary founds and qualifications to be able to go to Mars when it becomes possible. I don’t know why, but it might be the only thing I’m certain of. I need to be ready to go, I need to have the possibility to go when the opportunity arises.

It’s very scary to go to Mars. It’s not like it is my goal. It is just there. I have to be ready when we can go. And somewhere I would like not to go. I don’t want to go to Mars. I just know I will. If we set a colony on Mars, I’ll not be able to walk away from it. I don’t think anything will be able to stop me from going there, not even myself. It’s like my entire life so far has been designed to forge my mind in a way that it will not be able to resist the call to Mars. It is inevitable. Sealing for the new world as always been my true core. I will fucking end up on Mars.

It get even scarier today because for a few weeks now I have been dreaming about it more and more. And I am always dreaming of the same thing. The launch. Always, always, always. I don’t always remember, but now that I write about it, I realize I must have dream of it last night too. It’s a feeling. I can feel the fear, the apprehension. Everybody is fancy about going to Mars. “I’ll go to Mars, I’ll go to Mars”. But every night I feel it, the rooted fear. The fear you feel when you seat in the rocket and you pass this point where there is no turning back. This moment you buckle up and you seat there and you cannot leave, not anymore. I think it will be the deepest fear that I will feel in my life. Which is not exactly a surprise if you realize that I am already feeling it today. Like what the hell. If I go, it is, what, at least in ten years. And still I feel the fear already. It will not be easy to go to Mars. Far from that. I don’t think we realize. But I feel the feeling. I see it.

It’s hard to put words on it. But a rocket is not a plane. It’s not a car. The people who will go to Mars in our lifetime will not be going comfortably seated on a safe proven ship. It will be a fucking rocket. And fucking rockets blow up. How many died to go the Moon. Some of us will have to die. Some rockets will blow up. And those going will know the feeling. That feeling that takes your gluts and don’t let go until you are far away. Just to be replaced by the deep melancholy of knowing you left everything behind forever and will never come back for it. Do you feel that?

I made this dream at least five times recently, with three that I clearly remember. I don’t know why. I could be the fear already. I could be that the moment is so scary that the fear ripples in time. I am not sure we realize the kind of fear it is to seat there and wait. I think it is a death fear. It is probably the only way. Because to be there, you have to face death. You have to seat in the rocket. And let go of everything. You have to accept that from this moment you have no control anymore about anything. And no-one probably does. From this instant were you buckle up, you cannot go back. You have to seat there while you let your entire life behind you, loved ones, kids, wife, memories, everything. You have to seat there and wait. And at this point you are not waiting to see space, nor Mars with your own eyes, you are waiting for death. You are waiting to see if you will blow up and die or if you will make it to space. The rest of the journey is easy, and the landing will be ok, because you are already there and don’t have another way than landing anymore. But the take off. Damn, it will be something. It must have been something to go to the Moon. It must have been something to race to space in the sixties. You are not taking a plane. You are accepting to die and facing instant death as a probable outcome. I think it will be the real life changing moment. Not the landing on Mars, but the take off from Earth. It will be the moment when you go beyond everything life has ever been. I think you basically break you entire existence. It will be like the Big Bang for a human.

And that will be the beauty of the trip. It will be incredible. I don’t think we imagine. We are projecting our current life and our current selves on what we would be on Mars. But we don’t realize that all of us who will land there will have gone through this. Nobody will ever be the same. I think there will be a different kind of humanity up there. It might be transcendental for human race.

Any one going will see the limit of his being annihilated by facing death for real. By feeling the ultimate fear. It’s like the ticket to Mars will be to pass this life changing accident that some of us had to pass. This near-death experience. This moment your mind opens to a whole new level of perspective. 

Just imagine how it would be. Seating there, and seeing your life blowing up for ever, literally; or not with a bit of chance. And then a few minutes later you are in space, not yet fully recovered from your premature death, looking out to the stars, the Moon and Earth. That’s how it will start, the long journey to Mars. A life-changing death experience. And then six months lost in space, in the void of infinity surrounded by only the beauty of the valar and the conscience of the universe.

Almost dying in a car accident changes people. I’m not sure we realize how almost dying in a rocket and then spend six months hanging in the solar system will change people. Humans will leave Earth. But I guess from there, only Martians will know what it is to be Martian. We might not be the same species at landing.

I can’t wait to try very hard not to go there. I can’t wait to feel this unprecedented fear. I can’t wait to experience what comes after this instant. I don’t think it is possible to visualize what comes after that as a being. I don’t think you are the same person after that. Mars will not be Earth. No humans will step on Mars in this century. They will be something else entirely.
